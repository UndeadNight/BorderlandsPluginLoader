# Installation

1. Download the precompiled "ddraw.dll" and place it in your "Win32"-folder.
    For example:
    C:\Steam\steamapps\common\Borderlands 2\Binaries\Win32

2. Create a new folder called "Plugins", also in the Win32-folder.

3. Place any Plugin-Dll in that "Plugins"-folder.


 
## Currently available Plugins by me
